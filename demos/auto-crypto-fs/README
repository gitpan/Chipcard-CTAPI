This directory demonstrates how encrypted file systems can be created
with a random password, which is then stored on a smartcard, in Linux.

You should know how to create encrypted loopback file systems manually
before trying to understand this. You'll have to do several adjustments
to the scripts to fit your local configuration (like encryption algorithm
to use, etc.). Make sure you read through all the scripts and understand
what they do. Unless losetup and mount are suidroot on your system,
these scripts will have to be executed as root - so you better be aware
of what they do!

The first script needs to be run only once for each file system you want
to create.
The second script is for mounting your encrypted file system. It downloads
the password from your memory card, sets up the loopback device and
mounts it.
The third script is actually a shell-, not a Perl-script for unmounting
your encrypted file system. This is only necessary if you want to unmount
it manually. Automatic unmounting is done at system shutdown.

Note that you require the Perl "Expect" module for these scripts to work.
To install it, run 

perl -MCPAN -eshell
(possible first-time-configuration process here)
Then, at the CPAN shell, enter this command:
install IO::Pty IO::Tty Expect
