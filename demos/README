This directory contains a bunch of demo applications for Chipcard::CTAPI.

Be aware that they will only work after installing Chipcard::CTAPI using
"make install" in the toplevel distribution archive directory.

These demos don't really excel in user friendliness and error handling. 
Instead, they should demonstrate how chipcard-aware applications can 
easily be crafted in Perl when using Chipcard::CTAPI.
