Chipcard/CTAPI version 0.2
==========================

CTAPI is an industry standard for accessing chipcard terminals. CTAPI 
drivers are available for all popular card readers. Chipcard::CTAPI
is a Perl module which allows direct access to both memory cards
and processor cards (smartcards) based on the CTAPI library. Besides
the CTAPI functions themselves, Chipcard::CTAPI provides a series of 
convenience methods for easy reading and writing of memory cards.

Using CTAPI often has advantages over using the other popular card 
terminal framework, PC/SC. Most noticable is that setting up the CTAPI
drivers is an easy task even for less advanced end users and that it
has no run-time overhead. PC/SC on the other hand requires more work 
to set up and results in a daemon process running all the time. Thus,
using CTAPI is ideal when writing applications which can make use of
chipcards but don't focus on the communication with the card terminal
too much.

Chipcard::CTAPI is well documented and comes with a couple of demo
applications.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

1. Perl, Version 5.005 or higher (5.6 or higher recommended).
2. A working CTAPI library for your card terminal.
   If you're using the popular Towitoko card terminals, pick 
   libtowitoko from http://www.geocities.com/cprados/ .


INSTALLATION
------------

1. If you do NOT have a Towitoko card terminal, you'll have to edit
   Makefile.PL and change the LIBS line. It currently looks like this:

   'LIBS'              => ['-ltowitoko'], # PUT YOUR CARD TERMINAL ...

   Change the -ltowitoko to match your CTAPI library's name. For 
   example, if your library's filename is libsmarty123.so, you'd put
   -lsmarty123 between [' and '] .

2. Run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

   This should work without any errors. If it doesn't work, make sure
   ctapi.h and ctbcs.h as well as the library set in step 1 can be 
   found on your machine.

   If you want to test whether the communication with your card terminal
   actually works, edit the file quicktest.pl to make sure the correct
   physical port your card terminal is attached to is used, and then run

    perl ctapitest.pl

   If this works without errors so far, it is safe to run

    make install

   You might require root privileges for this last step depending on 
   your system.


EXAMPLES AND DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------

You can view the perl module's documentation using this command:

    perldoc Chipcard::CTAPI

If you're planning on using it in your own Perl programs, you should
take some time and read it all.

There's a couple of demo applications in the demos/ subdirectory of
the distribution archive. They're less useful by themselves, but show
how various operations can be done easily using Chipcard::CTAPI.


NOTES
-----

This version of Chipcard::CTAPI has only been tested with Towitoko
chipcard terminals. Although CTAPI is standardized, this module might
not work with your hardware. Please report problems.
